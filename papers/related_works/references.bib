    abstract = {Noise sources unavoidably affect any quantum technological device. Noise's main features are expected to strictly depend on the physical platform on which the quantum device is realized, in the form of a distinguishable fingerprint. Noise sources are also expected to evolve and change over time. Here, we first identify and then characterize experimentally the noise fingerprint of IBM cloud-available quantum computers, by resorting to machine learning techniques designed to classify noise distributions using time-ordered sequences of measured outcome probabilities.},

    abstract = {Maximizing the computational utility of near-term quantum processors requires predictive noise models that inform robust, noise-aware compilation and error mitigation. Conventional models often fail to capture the complex error dynamics of real hardware or require prohibitive characterization overhead. We introduce a data-efficient, machine learning-based framework to construct accurate, parameterized noise models for superconducting quantum processors. Our approach circumvents costly characterization protocols by learning hardware-specific error parameters directly from the measurement data of existing application and benchmark circuits. The generality and robustness of the framework are demonstrated through comprehensive benchmarking across multiple quantum devices and algorithms. Crucially, we show that a model trained exclusively on small-scale circuits accurately predicts the behavior of larger validation circuits. Our data-efficient approach achieves up to a 65\% improvement in model fidelity quantified by the Hellinger distance between predicted and experimental circuit output distributions, compared to standard noise models derived from device properties. This work establishes a practical paradigm for noise characterization, providing a crucial tool for developing more effective noise-aware compilation and error-mitigation strategies.},

    abstract = {Quantum computers progress toward outperforming classical supercomputers, but quantum errors remain their primary obstacle. The key to overcoming errors on near-term devices has emerged through the field of quantum error mitigation, enabling improved accuracy at the cost of additional run time. Here, through experiments on state-of-the-art quantum computers using up to 100 qubits, we demonstrate that without sacrificing accuracy machine learning for quantum error mitigation (ML-QEM) drastically reduces the cost of mitigation. We benchmark ML-QEM using a variety of machine learning models -- linear regression, random forests, multi-layer perceptrons, and graph neural networks -- on diverse classes of quantum circuits, over increasingly complex device-noise profiles, under interpolation and extrapolation, and in both numerics and experiments. These tests employ the popular digital zero-noise extrapolation method as an added reference. Finally, we propose a path toward scalable mitigation by using ML-QEM to mimic traditional mitigation methods with superior runtime efficiency. Our results show that classical machine learning can extend the reach and practicality of quantum error mitigation by reducing its overheads and highlight its broader potential for practical quantum computations.},

abstract = {Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionise multiple fields by solving complex problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time with current classical computers. Nevertheless, the development of quantum computers is still in its early stages and the available systems have still very limited resources. As such, currently, the most practical way to develop and test quantum algorithms is to use classical simulators of quantum computers. In addition, the development of new quantum computers and their components also depends on simulations. Given the characteristics of a quantum computer, their simulation is a very demanding application in terms of both computation and memory. As such, simulations do not scale well in current classical systems. Thus different optimisation and approximation techniques need to be applied at different levels. This review provides an overview of the components of a quantum computer, the levels at which these components and the whole quantum computer can be simulated, and an in-depth analysis of different state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Besides the optimisations that can be performed at the algorithmic level, this review presents the most promising hardware-aware optimisations and future directions that can be explored for improving the performance and scalability of the simulations.},

abstract = {Topological error correcting codes, and particularly the surface code, currently provide the most feasible road-map towards large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. As such, obtaining fast and flexible decoding algorithms for these codes, within the experimentally realistic and challenging context of faulty syndrome measurements, without requiring any final read-out of the physical qubits, is of critical importance. In this work, we show that the problem of decoding such codes can be naturally reformulated as a process of repeated interactions between a decoding agent and a code environment, to which the machinery of reinforcement learning can be applied to obtain decoding agents. While in principle this framework can be instantiated with environments modelling circuit level noise, we take a first step towards this goal by using deepQ learning to obtain decoding agents for a variety of simplified phenomenological noise models, which yield faulty syndrome measurements without including the propagation of errors which arise in full circuit level noise models.}

abstract = {A quantum computer needs the assistance of a classical algorithm to detect and identify errors that affect encoded quantum information. At this interface of classical and quantum computing the technique of machine learning has appeared as a way to tailor such an algorithm to the specific error processes of an experiment—without the need for a priori knowledge of the error model. Here, we apply this technique to topological color codes. We demonstrate that a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory cells can be trained to reduce the error rate ϵL of the encoded logical qubit to values much below the error rate ϵphys of the physical qubits—fitting the expected power law scaling , with d the code distance. The neural network incorporates the information from ‘flag qubits’ to avoid reduction in the effective code distance caused by the circuit. As a test, we apply the neural network decoder to a density-matrix based simulation of a superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating that the logical qubit has a longer life-time than the constituting physical qubits with near-term experimental parameters.}

We investigate quantum error correction and fault tolerance at small code distances using neural network-based decoders, demonstrating that the neural network can generalize to inputs that were not provided during training and that they can reach similar or better decoding performance compared to previous algorithms. We conclude by discussing the time required by a feedforward neural network decoder in hardware.}

abstract = {The Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM) algorithm has shown its potential for performing several tasks such as exploratory analysis, anomaly detection and forecasting on a variety of domains including the financial and cyber-security domains. GHSOM is a dynamic variant of the SOM algorithm which generates a multi-level hierarchy of SOM maps based solely on input data. However, in order to generate this multi-level structure, GHSOM requires multiple iterations over the input dataset, thus making it intractable on large datasets. Moreover, the conventional GHSOM algorithm is designed to handle datasets with numeric attributes only. This represents an important limitation as most modern real-world datasets are characterized by mixed attributes - numerical and categorical. In this work, we propose an extension of the conventional GHSOM algorithm called Spark-GHSOM, which exploits the Spark platform to process massive datasets in a distributed manner. Moreover, we leverage a method known as the distance hierarchy approach to modify the optimization function of GHSOM so that it can (also) coherently handle mixed-attribute datasets. We test our new method with respect to accuracy, scalability and descriptive power. The results obtained using different datasets demonstrate the superior predictive and descriptive capabilities of Spark-GHSOM, as well as its applicability to large-scale datasets which could not be analyzed before.}

    abstract = {The advancement and scaling of quantum technology has made the learning and identification of quantum systems and devices in highly-multidimensional parameter spaces a pressing task for a variety of applications. In many cases, the integration of real-time feedback control and adaptive choice of measurement settings places strict demands on the speed of this task. Here we present a joint model selection and parameter estimation algorithm that is fast and operable on a large number of model parameters. The algorithm is based on variational Bayesian inference (VBI), which approximates the target posterior distribution by optimizing a tractable family of distributions, making it more scalable than exact inference methods relying on sampling and that generally suffer from high variance and computational cost in high-dimensional spaces. We show how a regularizing prior can be used to select between competing models, each comprising a different number of parameters, identifying the simplest model that explains the experimental data. The regularization can further separate the degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum systems in the environment or processes, which contribute to major features in the observed dynamics, with respect to others featuring small coupling, which only contribute to a background. As an application of the introduced framework, we consider the problem of the identification of multiple individual nuclear spins with a single electron spin quantum sensor, relevant for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance. With the number of environmental spins unknown a priori, our Bayesian approach is able to correctly identify the model, i.e. the number of spins and their couplings. We benchmark the algorithm on both simulated and experimental data, using standard figures of merit, and demonstrating that we can estimate dozens of parameters within minutes.},
